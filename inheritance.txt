Code Reusability:
Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class. subclasses inherit the properties and methods of the existing parent class.
This promotes code reusability because you can use the existing class's functionality without rewriting it.
this was you can spend less time rewriting code.

Polymorphism and Interface Implementation:
Inheritance enables polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass/parent class.
This is useful when you want to define common functions or set up that multiple classes follow.
By using inheritance, you can create a variety of classes that use the same methods but behave differently based on their specific implementations.
This promotes flexibility in your program's design and allows you to write code that can work with objects of multiple related classes.
